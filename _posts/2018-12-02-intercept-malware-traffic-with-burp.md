Intercepting malware traffic with Burp Proxy

<!--more-->

## Lab network topology

The lab is made of two VMs: a REMnux machine and a Windows machine.

The **REMnux machine** has 2 network interfaces:
* the first one is configured on the virtual LAN segment `REMLab` (`eth0` with static IP `10.0.0.1`);

* the second one is configured in Bridge mode on the host main network interface (`eth1` with DHCP); this interface shall not normally be enabled unless Internet access is needed.

The **Windows machine** has 1 network interface configured on a virtual LAN segment `REMLab` with static IP `10.0.0.3`.

Traffic from the Windows machine will pass through the REMnux machine, because of the default gateway. Then, traffic to ports 80 or 443 will be redirected locally on the REMnux machine to port 8080 (ie: Burp). Burp will in turn redirect the traffic to its original destination or locally to a fake service (whichever is needed).

## Configuration of the REMnux machine

Step 1. Enable IP forwarding

```
remnux@remnux:~$ sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
```

Step 2. Enable iptables rules to forward all traffic sent to ports 80 and 443 to the port Burp will be listening to (`8080`)

```
remnux@remnux:~$ sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
remnux@remnux:~$ sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
remnux@remnux:~$ sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080
```

Step 3. Start a fake DNS service to answer any DNS request with the IP of this REMnux host. It can be either `fakedns` or `inetsim`.

```
remnux@remnux:~$ fakedns 10.0.0.1
```

Step 4. Start fake HTTP services with `inetsim`. Configure `/etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf` and be sure HTTP and HTTPS services are enabled and properly configured, then start the daemon.

```
remnux@remnux:~$ sudo service inetsim restart
```

Step 5. Open Burp Suite and configure it as follows:

* `Proxy -> Intercept` : set `intercept is off`

* `Proxy -> Options -> Proxy Listeners` : set or edit a listener to listen on port `8080` on all interfaces (`*.8080`); enable _invisible_ proxying; if needed, configure the redirect to the local address INETsim is listening to (`10.0.0.1:*`)

Step 6. Export the CA certificate of Burp Suite into a DER file; it shall be imported into the trust store on the Windows host. Go to `Proxy -> Options -> Import / Export CA certificate`.


## Configuration of the Windows machine

Step 1. Configure the default gateway to the IP of the REMnux host (`10.0.0.1`).

Step 2. Configure the DNS address to the IP of the REMnux host (`10.0.0.1`).

Step 3. Import the Burp Suite CA certificate (see above) into the browser trust store (either Internet Explorer or Firefox or whatever).
