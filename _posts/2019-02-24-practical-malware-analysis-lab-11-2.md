This is a walkthrough of the Lab 11-2 from the book _Practical Malware Analysis_. The sample under analysis, `Lab11-02.dll`, is a user-mode rootkit that performs inline hooking. The analysis of hooking mechanism is very interesting.

<!--more-->

The [samples for this lab can be downloaded from here](https://github.com/iosonogio/PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs).

Let's start!

## Static analysis

I'm going to perform some basic static analysis first.

### Hashes

`Lab11-02.dll`

MD5 | be4f4b9e88f2e1b1c38e0a0858eb3dd9
SHA1 | 79787427773dcce211e8e65e1156bd60535494ec
SHA256 | df899256c4a9fc0e550c62b84ab9cb8acd8d18683f0a41c98ba83f0487d4766e

### Imports

Some interesting imports that the program uses are:

* from `ADVAPI32.DLL`, `RegOpenKeyEx` and `RegSetValueEx`
* from `KERNEL32.DLL`, `CopyFile`, `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot`, `OpenThread`, `ResumeThread`, `SuspendThread`, `VirtualProtect`, `LoadLibrary`, `GetProcAddress`.

The functions `RegOpenKeyEx` and `RegSetValueEx` suggest that this malware manipulates registry keys.

The function `CopyFile` may indicate that the malware will make a copy of some file (maybe itself?).

The function `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` returns a snapshot of current processes, heaps, threads and modules; malware often uses this function to iterate through running processes or threads. The functions `OpenThread`, `ResumeThread`, `SuspendThread` suggest that indeed the malware is manipulating threads. The function `VirtualProtect` is used to modify the protection settings of a memory region; if this is done on a running thread, then the thread shall be suspended first in order to avoid malfunctions.

The functions `LoadLibrary`, `GetProcAddress` are an indication that the malware is using other functions from other DLLs, loading them at runtime.

### Exports

This DLL exports a function named `installer`. This may be some installation routing. I can install the malware executing:

```
rundll32.exe Lab11-02.dll,installer
```

### Strings

These are some interesting strings:

```
THEBAT.EXE
OUTLOOK.EXE
MSIMN.EXE
RCPT TO: <
send
wsock32.dll
SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows
AppInit_DLLs
\spoolvxx32.dll
\Lab11-02.ini
```

The string `AppInit_DLLs` may indicate that this malware achieve persistence by using AppInit_DLLs: the DLLs listed in the value `AppInit_DLLs` found in this registry key `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows`, are loaded into every process that uses `User32.dll`. (See [Microsoft documentation on AppInit_DLLs](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/197571/working-with-the-appinit-dlls-registry-value) for more information.)

The strings `wsock32.dll` and `send` suggest that this malware may perform network activity. Since there are no imports of networking functions, the malware would load networking DLLs via `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress` (which indeed are present in the imports).

The string `RCPT TO: <` may indicate that the malware uses the SMTP protocol somehow. It's also worth noting that there are strings referring to the names of some email clients: The Bat, Outlook and Outlook Express.

We also see the name of a DLL `spoolvxx32.dll` (maybe the malware hides itself under this name?) and a .ini file (maybe a configuration file?).

# Code Analysis with IDA Pro and OllyDbg

Let's dig in the code with IDA Pro and OllyDbg.

## `installer` exported function

This function is used to install the malware and make it persistent. Persistence is achieved by using `AppInit_DLLs`. The program opens the registry key `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows` and set the value `AppInit_DLLs` to `%SystemRoot%\System32\spoolvxx32.dll`.

Then the malicious DLL copies itself to `%SystemRoot%\System32\spoolvxx32.dll`. The name of the source file to copy is stored in the global variable `ExistingFileName` which was set by `DLLMain` to the full path of the current module.

## `DLLMain` function

The `DLLMain` function reads from a file named `Lab11-02.ini` located in the SystemDirectory (`%SystemRoot%\System32\Lab11-02.ini`). The content of this file seems to be encrypted.

### `sub_100010B3` function (`Sub_Decoder`)

Since the bytes read from this file are passed to the function `sub_100010B3` (at `0x100016CA`), I expect that this function contains some decryption routine - indeed the function contains a loop and bytes-manipulating instructions (like `XOR`). Let's analyze this function's behavior in OllyDbg.

I will place a breakpoint at `0x100016CA`, when the function is called. After step-following the execution in the debugger I obtain **the decrypted value read from the .ini file: `billy@malwareanalysisbook.com`**. This value is placed in `byte_100034A0`, so I will rename this location to `Email_Address`. Also I will rename the function `sub_100010B3` to `Sub_Decoder`.

### `sub_100014B6` function (`Sub_InstallHook`)

After the .ini file is decrypted, the `DLLMain` calls the function `sub_100014B6` (at `0x100016E2`) before terminating.
This function first calls a subroutine to get the full path of the current module (I renamed this subroutine to `Sub_GetModuleFileNameWrapper`); then (at `0x100014D6`) it calls a subroutine to extract the executable name from the full path; next it places that name in `var_4` and converts it to uppercase (at `0x100014F0`).

A series of string comparisions follows: the malware is comparing the name of the current executable (that it just obtained from the previous instructions) to those of three email clients: `THEBAT.EXE`, `OUTLOOK.EXE` and `MSIMN.EXE` (the last one is Outlook Express).

Let's keep in mind that this malicious DLL is loaded via `AppInit_DLLs`: that means it is loaded into every process that loads `User32.dll`. The Bat, Outlook and Outlook Express will surely do, but they are not the only processes that loads `User32.dll`: the malware is checking the name of the executable it was loaded into to decide what to do next.

So **when the malicious DLL is loaded by one of those email clients (and only by those), it will continue on with its malicious behavior.**

_Note: if I try to execute the DLL within OllyDbg I will most probably see LOADDLL.EXE as the executable name: this is used by OllyDbg to load and execute a DLL._

If the malware was loaded by any of those email clients, the program jumps to to `0x10001561`:

```assembly
10001561 loc_10001561:
10001561 call    sub_100013BD
10001566 push    offset dword_10003484 ; int
1000156B push    offset sub_1000113D ; int
10001570 push    offset aSend    ; "send"
10001575 push    offset aWsock32_dll ; "wsock32.dll"
1000157A call    sub_100012A3
1000157F add     esp, 10h
10001582 call    sub_10001499
```

This code block contains four functions to analyze!

## `sub_100013BD` function (`Sub_SuspendThreads`)

The function `sub_100013BD` gets the `CurrentProcessId` and passes it as a parameter to the function `sub_100012FE`.

The function `sub_100012FE` starts by getting the address of the `OpenThread` function in `kernel32.dll`, and saves it in `var_4` (renamed to `Address_OpenThread`). The subroutine `sub_10001000` is a wrapper to `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress`, so I will rename it to `Sub_GetProcAddressWrapper`.

Next the program gets the `CurrentThreadId`, saving it in `var_28` (renamed to `Var_CurrentThreadId`), and then calls `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` (at `0x10001333`) to get a snapshot of the running threads. It then cycles through the running threads: if the thread Id is not that of the current thread (comparision is made on the `CurrentThreadId` at `0x10001360`) then it accesses the thread by calling `OpenThread` at `0x10001375`, and suspends it by calling `SuspendThread` at `0x10001389`.

So the function `sub_100012FE` **suspends all but the current thread**. I will rename it to `Sub_SuspendThreads_Inner`, and rename `sub_100013BD` to `Sub_SuspendThreads`.

## `sub_10001499` function (`Sub_ResumeThreads`)

The function `sub_10001499` at the end of the code block, and its inner function `sub_100013DA`, are the same as `sub_100013BD` and its inner `sub_100012FE`, but with one difference: their purpose is to **_resume_ the threads that were previously suspended**. So I will rename them to (guess?) `Sub_ResumeThreads` and `Sub_ResumeThreads_Inner`.

So the malware is suspending the running threads and calling the function `sub_100012A3`.

## `sub_100012A3` function (`Sub_PlaceHook_Outer`)

This function takes four arguments (those pushed on the stack in the code block above):

```
sub_100012A3("wsock32.dll", "send", sub_1000113D, dword_10003484)
```

The program here gets the address of the `send` function in the `wsock32.dll` module (using `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress`); then at `0x100012F2` it calls `sub_10001203` passing in three parameters:

```
sub_10001203( <Address of "send">, sub_1000113D, dword_10003484)
```

Let's follow `sub_10001203` down the rabbit hole: as we will see this function **performs inline hooking of the `send` function** - so I will rename it to `Sub_PlaceHook`. And I will rename the function `sub_100012A3` to `Sub_PlaceHook_Outer`.

## `sub_10001203` function (`Sub_PlaceHook`)

After the prologue, this function calculates the relative offset between the `sub_1000113D` function, ie the "hooking" function performing the malicious behavior (as we'll see shortly) - and thus renamed to `Sub_Hooking`, and the function that gets hooked, ie `send`; then it further subtracts 5 bytes, and places the result into `var_4`.

```assembly
10001209 mov     eax, [ebp+Address_Sub_Hooking]
1000120C sub     eax, [ebp+Address_send]
1000120F sub     eax, 5
10001212 mov     [ebp+var_4], eax
```

What's happening here?

In order to _hook_ the `send` function, the malware needs to **place a JMP instruction at the beginning of the `send` function** to jump to the hooking function that performs the malicious behavior. To place this JMP, it needs to calculate the relative offset, or _displacement_, for the jump.

When the CPU prepares to execute a relative JMP instruction, the new Instruction Pointer is calculated as follows:

```
IP(new) = IP(current) + 5 + displacement
```

Why 5? It is the length of the unconditional JMP instruction: the `E9` opcode (1 byte) plus the 32-bit address (4 bytes displacement).

Since we are jumping from `send` to `Sub_Hooking`, the displacement of the relative jump is:

```
displacement = Address_Sub_Hooking - Address_send - 5
```

So now `var_4` contains the displacement of the JMP instruction to jump from the `send` to the hooking function. I will rename `var_4` to `Var_DisplaceToHooking`.

Let's move on:

In order to place a hook a the beginning of the `send` function, the malware first needs to change the protection settings of that memory region - (it also needs to suspend the running threads before modifying the memory!). The hook is 5 bytes long, so the malware needs to change the protection settings of the first 5 bytes starting from the address of `send`.

To do this the malware calls `VirtualProtect`:

```assembly
10001215 lea     ecx, [ebp+flOldProtect]
10001218 push    ecx             ; lpflOldProtect
10001219 push    PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE ; flNewProtect
1000121B push    5               ; dwSize
1000121D mov     edx, [ebp+Address_send]
10001220 push    edx             ; lpAddress
10001221 call    ds:VirtualProtect
```

`VirtualProtect` takes four parameters:

```
VirtualProtect(lpAddress, size, NewProtect, lpOldProtect)
```

The new protection is `PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE` because write permission is needed. The old protection value is saved into `flOldProtect` to be restored later.

Next, the program allocates 255 bytes of memory:

```assembly
10001227 push    0FFh            ; size_t
1000122C call    malloc
10001231 add     esp, 4
10001234 mov     [ebp+var_8], eax
```

The address of the newly allocated memory is saved into `var_8`.

What's this memory region for?

This is the memory region that the malware uses to create a _trampoline_. **The purpose of the trampoline is to jump back into the hooked function bypassing the hook itself!** At the beginning of the trampoline the malware must also **save the first 5 bytes of the `send` function that were overwritten by the hook (the "stolen bytes")**.

So I will rename `var_8` to `Address_Trampoline`, because it is the address of a memory region the serves the purpose of a trampoline.

In the next five instructions, the malware saves the address of the `send` function in the first 4 bytes of the trampoline region, then it writes the value `5` into the next byte. I don't know why... and I won't care!

```assembly
10001237 mov     eax, [ebp+Address_Trampoline]
1000123A mov     ecx, [ebp+Address_send]
1000123D mov     [eax], ecx
1000123F mov     edx, [ebp+Address_Trampoline]
10001242 mov     byte ptr [edx+4], 5
```

Then the malware copies (`memcpy`) the first 5 bytes of the `send` function into the trampoline region pointed to by (`Address_Trampoline` + 5 bytes):

```assembly
10001246 push    5               ; size_t
10001248 mov     eax, [ebp+Address_send]        ; source
1000124B push    eax             ; void *
1000124C mov     ecx, [ebp+Address_Trampoline]  ; destination
1000124F add     ecx, 5
10001252 push    ecx             ; void *
10001253 call    memcpy
10001258 add     esp, 0Ch
```

Here the malware is assuming that the `send` function’s first instructions align exactly on 5 bytes, which might not always be the case.

Immediately following in the trampoline region, the malware writes the byte `0xE9`:

```assembly
1000125B mov     edx, [ebp+Address_Trampoline]
1000125E mov     byte ptr [edx+0Ah], 0E9h
```

What is this? **`E9` is the opcode of the unconditional JMP instruction**; the 4 bytes that follow must be the displacement of the relative jump. Since we are jumping from the trampoline back into the `send` function, the displacement is calculated as (the values shown here come from OllyDbg):

```
displacement = Address_send - Address_Trampoline - 0x0A
             = 0x71AB4C27 - 0x003625A0 - 0x0A
             = 0x7175267D
```

`0x0A` is the sum of the length of the JMP instruction (5 bytes) and 5 more bytes **to jump _into_ the `send` function in order to bypass the hook!**

The 4-byte displacement is written immediately after the `E9` opcode (starting at offset `0x0B`)>

```assembly
10001262 mov     eax, [ebp+Address_send]
10001265 sub     eax, [ebp+Address_Trampoline]
10001268 sub     eax, 0Ah
1000126B mov     ecx, [ebp+Address_Trampoline]
1000126E mov     [ecx+0Bh], eax
```

This is what gets written in the trampoline region:

```
003625A0  27 4C AB 71 05 8B FF 55
003625A8  8B EC E9 7D 26 75 71
003625B0  
```

When the Instruction Pointer points at `0x003625AA`, i.e. at opcode `E9`, the JMP will be executed; the new instruction pointer is then calculated as follows:

```
IP(new) = IP(current) + 5 + displacement
        = 0x003625AA + 5 + 0x7175267D
		    = 0x71AB4C2C
```

This is exactly 5 bytes into the send function, so bypassing the hook!

We can see the same thing by disassembling the dump in OllyDbg:

```
003625AA  -E9 7D267571      JMP WS2_32.71AB4C2C
```

Next the JMP opcode `E9` is copied into the beginning of the `send` function, followed by the displacement `Var_DisplaceToHooking` to jump from the `send` function to the hooking function:

```assembly
10001271 mov     edx, [ebp+Address_send]
10001274 mov     byte ptr [edx], 0E9h
10001277 mov     eax, [ebp+Address_send]
1000127A mov     ecx, [ebp+Var_DisplaceToHooking]
1000127D mov     [eax+1], ecx
```

Now a new call to `VirtualProtect` restores the original protection settings on the memory region of the `send` function.

Lastly, `Address_Dword_10003484` is modified to point to 5 bytes into the trampoline, i.e. where the stolen bytes of the `send` function were saved. I renamed `Address_Dword_10003484` to `Address_ToTrampoline`.

```assembly
10001294 mov     edx, [ebp+Address_Trampoline]
10001297 add     edx, 5              ; 5 bytes into the trampoline
1000129A mov     eax, [ebp+Address_ToTrampoline]
1000129D mov     [eax], edx
```

## Placing hook wrap-up

So to wrap up so far, the function `sub_100014B6` installs a hook at the beginning of the `send` function - I will rename it to `Sub_InstallHook`. The hook jumps to the hooking function which I'll be analyzing in a moment. The hook installation routing also create a trampoline to jump back into the `send` function bypassing the hook.

The last function left for analysis is the hooking function that actually performs the malicious behavior.

## `sub_1000113D` function (`Sub_Hooking`)

The function `sub_1000113D` is the hooking function that performs the malicious behavior. It takes the same arguments as the hooked function `send` (it can be redefined in IDA Pro by using _Set Function Type_):

```
send(SOCKET s, char * buf, int len, int flags)
```

The `Sub_Hooking` function searches for the substring `RCPT TO:` in the buffer associated to the socket.

If none is found then it jumps to location `0x100011E4` and calls the original `send` function using the `Address_ToTrampoline` (at `0x100011F4`). If that string is found, then the program builds the string `RCPT TO: <billy@malwareanalysisbook.com>\r\n` and places it into the buffer.

In other words, **the hooking function adds a new recipient to any email that is sent out using one of those email clients.**
Then it calls `Address_ToTrampoline` to jump back into the hooked function.


## Hooking diagram

This is a diagram to show how the hooking works:

![hooking diagram](/media/pma/lab-11-02/hooking.png)


## Running the malware

Let's try running the malware and observing its behavior!

I will run Outlook Express and send an email to a fake SMTP server running on my REMnux host. I'm going to use ApateDNS to resolve every DNS name query to my REMnux host and INetSim as the fake SMTP server.

To install the malware I will manually place the `.ini` file under `%SystemRoot%\System32` and then run this command:

```
rundll32.exe Lab11-02.dll,installer
```

If I check in the registry, now the key `SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows` has `AppInit_DLLs` set to `%SystemRoot%\System32\spoolvxx32.dll`: that's the location where the malware placed a copy of itself.

Next I start Outlook Express: looking at the loaded DLLs with Process Explorer, I can spot the malicious `spoolvxx32.dll`.

![msimn with malicious dll loaded](/media/pma/lab-11-02/msimn.png)

Then I compose a new email and send it to `johnny@malware.lab`. Looking at the SMTP server log, we can see that the message has two recipients indeed: the second one `billy@malwareanalysisbook.com` was added by the malware.

```
connect
send: 220 mail.inetsim.org INetSim Mail Service ready.
recv: HELO remwindowsxp
send: 250 mail.inetsim.org
recv: MAIL FROM: <johnny@malware.lab>

recv: RCPT TO: <billy@malwareanalysisbook.com>

recv: .
info: Message id: <CD43BED5-ed51bfbe05aa0559b04dfd109370f10c1be1ba67@mail.inetsim.org>
```

If we attach to the Outlook Express process `msimn.exe` with OllyDbg, we can see the hooked function `send` in `WS2_32.dll`. Notice the `JMP` instruction right at the beginning to jump to the hooking function (`0x1000113D`) in the malicious `spoolvxx` DLL:

![hook](/media/pma/lab-11-02/ollydbg-ws2_32-hook.png)

And this is the trampoline: the malware saved here the 5 bytes stolen from the hooked function (`8B FF 55 8B EC` which indeed disassemble to those instructions) followed by a jump back into the hooked function to _bypass_ the hook (to `0x71AB4C2C`):

![msimn with malicious dll loaded](/media/pma/lab-11-02/ollydbg-msimn-trampoline.png)

That's all for this lab!
