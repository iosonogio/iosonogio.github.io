This article describes the steps for a basic static analysis of malware.

# Scan with Antivirus

You can use a cloud service such as [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) to get a report about your malware sample. Be careful because malware authors may be monitoring such services to see if their malware has been discovered.

# Hash the Sample

Get the hash fingerprint of your malware sample. The most common algorithms to use are MD5, SHA1 and SHA256; get all three of them.

The hash can then be used:
- as a label, to name the malware sample
- to share it with other malware analysts
- to search for it online

# Find Strings

Search for meaningful strings contained in your malware sample.

ascii unicode

# Detect Packer

Periodic

upx



# Analyze PE Headers

imported functions

exported functions

compile timestamp


PEview

Resource Hacker
